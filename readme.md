This system was designed to replace the existing paper-driven evaluations used by the university to save on costs and be more environmentally friendly.

### Features
Just a few major (or noteworthy) features of the system are listed here:

1. Students can fill evaluations **anonymously** with any internet connected device with a modern web browser.
1. Reports on the evaluations can be viewed by faculty members and other persons of interest (dean, provost, president, etc).
1. Simple statistics can be generated from these reports (best & worst course, best & worst department, etc).
1. List of courses and their details in a spreadsheet can be added directly to the system by the admin through an upload form.
